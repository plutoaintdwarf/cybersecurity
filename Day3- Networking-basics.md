# Day 3 – Networking Basics (Cybersecurity Foundation)

## 1. Client and Server

Client:
A device that requests data or services.
Examples: Mobile phone, laptop, web browser.

Server:
A powerful computer that provides data or services.
Examples: Google server, YouTube server, website hosting servers.

Example:
When we type google.com in a browser:
- Our computer = Client
- Google’s machine = Server

This working system is called the Client–Server Model.

## 2. IP Address

An IP address is a unique number given to every device on a network.

Examples:
- 192.168.1.1
- 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)

Just like a home address identifies where someone lives,
an IP address identifies where a device exists on a network.

Types of IP Address:
- IPv4 → 192.168.0.1
- IPv6 → 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

## 3. DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.

Example:
We type → google.com  
DNS converts it → 8.8.8.8  
Then our computer connects to Google’s server.

DNS works like a phone contact list.

## 4. Ports

A Port is a number that tells which service is running on a device.

Common Ports:
- 80 → HTTP
- 443 → HTTPS
- 22 → SSH
- 21 → FTP

IP Address tells WHERE the device is.
Port tells WHICH service to talk to.

## 5. HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP:
Data is sent in plain text.
Not secure.

HTTPS:
Data is encrypted.
Secure.

Cybersecurity professionals always prefer HTTPS.

## 6. Network

A Network is created when multiple devices connect to share data.

Examples:
- Home WiFi
- College network
- Office LAN
- The Internet

Types of Networks:
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)

## 7. Important Cybersecurity Terms

Network – Group of connected devices  
IP Address – Unique device number  
DNS – Converts website name to IP  
Port – Door for services  
Client – Requests data  
Server – Provides data  
HTTP – Insecure web  
HTTPS – Secure web
